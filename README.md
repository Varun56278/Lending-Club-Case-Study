# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## General Information
- Business Objectives.
- importing the libraries
- We are applying our loan dataset
- Checking the shape of dataset
- displaying summary statistics
- Visualizing annual income column using boxplot
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- correlation of all columns 
- null values in the dataset
- Replacing the emp_length col. with the emp_length_dict in the dataset
- counting the unique values in emp_length column
- converting revol_util column to numeric type
- counting the unique values in term column
- counting the unique values in loan_status column
- Univariate and Segmented Univariate Analysis
- Visualizing the annual_inc column using box plot
- Outlier Treatment
- showing the count of observations in loan_status column using Seaborn.Countplot
- Converting the sub_grade to numeric
- Analyse home_ownership
- Analyse Purpose
- Analyzing interest rate wrt the interest rate bins created
- Analyse open_acc_groups
- Analyse revol_util_groups
- Analyse total_acc_groups
- Analyse annual_inc_groups
- Analyse verification_status
- Analyse inq_last_6mths
- Analyse pub_rec
- Annual income vs loan purpose
- Annual income vs home ownership
- Annual Income vs Loan amount
- Analysing loan_amount with other columns for more insights
- Loan Amount vs Interest Rate
- Loan vs Loan purpose
- Loan vs House Ownership
- Loan amount vs month issued and year issued
- Loan amount vs Grade
- Employees with longer working history got the loan approved for a higher amount.
- grade vs interest rate
- The interest rate for charged off loans is pretty high than that of fully paid loans in all the loan_amount 
- The above analysis with respect to the charged off loans. There is a more probability of defaulting.



## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Applicants taking loan for 'home improvement' and have income of 60k -70k
- Conclusion 2 home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have income of 60-70k
- Conclusion 3 receive interest at the rate of 21-24% and have an income of 70k-80k
- Conclusion 4 have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %
- Conclusion 5 have taken a loan for small business and the loan amount is greater than 14k
- Conclusion 6 home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have loan of 14-16k
- Conclusion 7 loan amount is between 15k-20k
- Conclusion 8 employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k
